#Notes

Q1. Why are my contributions not showing up on my profile? 
A1: Add the email address to your GitHub account by setting your commit email address, so that your commits are attributed to you and appear in your contributions graph.
$ git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
Confirm that you have set the email address correctly in Git:
$ git config --global user.email
email@example.com
