### 2. Why are my contributions not showing up on my profile? 

* Add the email address to your GitHub account by setting your commit email address, so that your commits are attributed to you and appear in your contributions graph.

    `$ git config --global user.email "email@example.com" `

* Confirm that you have set the email address correctly in Git:

    `$ git config --global user.email `

    ` email@example.com `
